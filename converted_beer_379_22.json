  "description": "Oktoberfest beer was originally brewed to celebrate the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig (destined to become King Ludwig I) to Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810. Flash forward more than two centuries and Oktoberfest is a personal favorite of head brewer, John Martin, who celebrated his marriage to Katie by buying homebrew equipment on their honeymoon … in October. We used plenty of German Munich and Vienna malt as well as CaraMunich malt to five this beer its rich, amber color and full-bodied, toasty flavor. Celebrate your favorite occasion with a mug of this delicious fall brew. Prost!",
