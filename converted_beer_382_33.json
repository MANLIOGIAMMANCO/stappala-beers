  "description": "Old Fort Black IPA was pulled from Natty Greene’s Master Brewers’ archives as one of the most popular brews of their portfolio. It is a medium-bodied, hoppy, dark ale brewed with a variety of dark malts and west coast hops to create a completely complex and unique taste. Old Fort has an ABV of 6.8%, an IBU of 66, and a SRM of 45.\r\n\r\nOld Fort Black IPA is the second of eight limited-batch draft-only beers in Natty Greene’s Silo Series. Its dark color gives way to a light brown head, hoppy nose, and full mouth feel. Only available in March and April, Old Fort is the perfect transition from chilly winter to crisp spring.",
