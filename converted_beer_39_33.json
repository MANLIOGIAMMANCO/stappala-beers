  "description": "Taking its name from the notorious great-great uncle of Bad Tom Brewing co-founder, Sean Smith, Bad Tom Ale promises to continue drawing the attention of the crowds. Noted for its unique taste, this ale is popular all across the broad spectrum of beer fans. \r\n\r\nMaster Brewer and cofounder, Charles Boucher, has fine-tuned his sixgrain/ 3 hop Irish Brown recipe to become the initial offering, and the flagship brew, of Bad Tom Brewing. \r\n\r\nBad Tom is a medium bodied ale with rich reddish-brown color, a small tan head and a fruity aroma. With an essence of toasted malt combined with candied nuts and a light caramel flavor, the smooth texture is finely balanced with a blend of hops and an unforgettable clean finish. The result is an all-around balanced beer with the most important ingredient of allâ€” GREAT TASTE!",
