  "description": "Old Factory Whistle, our signature ale, is patterned after red ales that have a rich Scottish heritage.\r\nThis ale utilizes crystal, pale, chocolate and Munich malts with a dose of roasted barley resulting in a complex mixture of the toasty flavors of caramel malt and sweetness, and a classic rich red color.\r\nEnglish Kent Golding hops add to the depth and help produce that pleasing balance.",
