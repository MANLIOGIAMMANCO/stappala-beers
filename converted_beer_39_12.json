  "description": "Our porter is brewed in the traditional English style. It has a deep brown color and a creamy tan head. The mouth feel is highlighted with soft notes of chocolate and slight undertones of roasted coffee. Hop bitterness is nicely balanced with the malt and hop aroma being very low, typical of the English style.",
