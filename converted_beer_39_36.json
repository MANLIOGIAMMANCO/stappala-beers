After all, laziness is a team sport.”\r\n\r\nDRINK NOW. MOW LATER.\r\n\r\nLawnmower Lager IPL is a citrusy hop-forward India Pale Lager. The perfect hot summer day’s beer. Lots of hop flavor and aroma; not overly bitter. Nice, smooth finish. Falconer’s Flight hops backed up by Glacier. Bright, golden color with a thick, creamy head. All malt grain bill ￼(no adjuncts).",
