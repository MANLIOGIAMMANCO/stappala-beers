  "description": "A finely balanced beer with a distinctive rich malty taste and fruity aroma, Old Speckled Hen has attracted many fans, including the fox, who is always on the hunt for his Hen.\r\n \r\nFirst brewed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the MG car factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, and affectionately named after an old MG car used as a factory runaround 'the owld speckled un'. This turned into Old Speckled Hen when the beer was unveiled.\r\nOld Speckled Hen has a full, smooth flavour and is very easy to drink. Its rich amber colour and superb fruity aromas are complemented by a delicious blend of malty tastes. Toffee and malt combine with bitterness on the back of the tongue to give a balanced sweetness, followed by a refreshingly dry finish.",
