  "description": "The Old Familiar is an authentic barley wine. It is made from malted barley like all of our beers, but with the strength and body approaching that of a wine. This full flavored ale is nicely balanced with Cascade hops from the American Northwest. We put plenty of these classic citrus flavored hops into the boil and then add even more after fermentation is complete. At 8.5% ABV this limited edition strong beer will be served only in pints and ten ounce pours.",
