  "description": "Baderbräu Red Velvet is a contemporary take on a classic German bock, a hoppy bock if you will. Red Velvet is a deep red, full-bodied malt bomb with a pronounced hop bitterneess in the creamy head followed by big, complex, dark, and chewy malts; long, lingering caramel flavors; and a touch of delicious sweetness. Pair as you would a fine port or sauterne. Great with strong, sharp and nutty or stinky and blue-veined cheeses; nut meats; dried and sugar-plumped fruits; and chocolate- especially dark bitter. Excels with fowl, including turkey, goose, duck, pheasant, quail, and squab.",
