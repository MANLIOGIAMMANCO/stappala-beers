  "description": "Straub Oktoberfest pours a white foamy head, with a malty aroma and rich with notes of dried fruit. The taste is bready with mild hop bitterness on the finish. Overall, Straub Oktoberfest was brewed in the classic Oktoberfest & Marzen style. We used three German malts to provide the rich, bready malt character that fills the aroma and taste. The mild hop bitterness balances the sweetness and helps to create a balanced \"festbier\" for your enjoyment.",
