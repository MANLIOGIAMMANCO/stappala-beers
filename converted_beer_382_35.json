  "description": "Season’s greetings! Your Old Friend is in town. We may only see each other once a year, but when we do it’s something special. Old Friend is a limited release holiday ale brewed with fresh ginger root and a hefty dollop of family harvested honey. This fireside companion has a deep ruby-colored body with layers of malt complexity and an intense ginger aroma. Give thanks and reflect on a good year past with an Old Friend by your side. Cheers!",
