  "description": "In 1810, the most memorable beer party ever (up to then) was thrown in honor of a Bavarian king. Since then, this party has been observed annually in Munich, going on to became the world-famous beer extravaganza known as Oktoberfest.\r\n\r\nWe expect many of you are planning to throw even more memorable parties this season. We have the perfect beer for these celebrations: In line with tradition, this 2013 Lisle Ale Fest People’s-Choice winner is an amber-colored, single-decocted, easy-drinking lager with a rich, malty flavor.\r\n\r\nThis Oktoberfest, make some great memories with Baderbrau Oktoberfest and friends. Raise a glass and toast with us. Prost!",
