  "description": "This fruit beer has a gorgeous clear copper colored sunrise appearance. Its bouquet reminds you of your grandmother’s fresh baked cherry pie. Hints of your grandfathers’ cherry tobacco cigars. Different glimpses of cherries swirl around the glass: Maraschino; almond extract; cherry pit; shortcake; Saturday morning Pop Tarts- you choose the memory... Sweet malts and subtle spicy cinnamon aroma. Alcohol warmth & bitterness balances so well with its sweet & sour. Chewy sweet malty mouthfeel. Drying finish of cherry skins. Perfect summer drinking, lazy lake paddling bliss..\r\n\r\nThis beer is available only on Tap in the Northern Colorado Area",
  "type": "Hybrid/mixed Beer"
