  "description": "One of the greatest military honors is the privilege to serve with the 3rd U.S. Infantry, otherwise known as the Old Guard.  This prestigious unit serves as the official escort to the President, and its members maintain a constant vigilance over the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.  In 1996, the first woman proudly joined its ranks.\r\n\r\nSBC's first spring seasonal honors these noble sentinels with a traditional biere de garde, a malt-focused ale accented by yaupon honey from the Savannah Bee Co.  This coppery brew's ripe fruit notes and woodsy, cellar-like aroma come from a honey yeast strain cultivated from the brewery's own small apiary.",
