  "description": "Our fall seasonal is an ode to the brewing traditions of Germany. This amber lager is brewed in true Reinheitsgebot fashion using the finest imported German Malt, German Hops and German Yeast. Incredibly clean and balanced, this lager has a wonderful malty backbone and a hint of earthy hops. Traditionally released in early fall, this beer will make you want to stand up and sing \"Ein Prosit!\"\r\n\r\nThe Oktoberfest in Munich started in 1810 as a celebration of the wedding of Crown Prince Ludwig and Princess Therese. The festival was such a hit that it turned into an annual event celebrated for 16 days from late September to early October. Oktoberfest beer comes from the Marzen style. These beers were bigger, richer beers brewed in March and stored in caves during the hot months of summer. In the fall, they were enjoyed at the Oktoberfest celebration.",
