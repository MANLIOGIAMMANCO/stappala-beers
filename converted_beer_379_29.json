  "description": "Our 2014 Festbier! We brewed this amber lager back at the beginning of July in order to give it enough time to condition in our lager room. A smooth, traditional MÃ¤rzen-style Festbier to be released just before the cooler days of Fall arrive. Malty, caramel body with a hint of noble hop bitterness for a balanced finish. 5.5% ABV",
  "type": "North American Lager"
