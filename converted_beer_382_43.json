  "description": "The legendary Old Growler - what a pedigree, what a porter! Like a grumpy old family pet much loved for its independent character and suffer-no-fools attitude, yet its curmudgeonly appearance belying its gentle character and easy going nature. The only beer to have twice won Overall Champion at the CAMRA Winter Beer Festival; its many awards also include Supreme Champion at the Chicago International Beer Festival and voted Best of 2011 by the Beer Tasting Institute of America, so it's even top dog across the pond. A complex, satisfying Porter, smooth and distinctive. Roast malt and fruit feature on the palate and the finish is powerfully hoppy. Tantalising taste buds since 1988. Now where did we put that Crufts entry form, it must be time for another award by now?",
