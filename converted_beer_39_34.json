  "description": "Yes, this is Kid Rock's beer. This is an American Beer. A Michigan Lager. Made in Detroit. Pop the top and you'll meet its Badass attitude. An attitude that embodies the never quit swagger of Detroiters that stretches across the nation and back. This Detroit made beer doesn't just share Kid Rock's home state roots, it casts the same kind of net that his music does: far, wide and all-out original.\r\n\r\nIt's born out of bushels of American barley and hops harvested straight from the Heartland. It's crafted with care in a place where factories mark one horizon and wild forest mark the next. This beer's built with American pride. Pry one open and you'll know: there's trouble brewing. This is pure American Badass.",
