  "description": "For the first in our series of NyePA’s, The Brewers of Nye Hill Farm chose six varieties of hops. While we love the bitterness of a hopped up Pale Ale, we wanted a beer everyone could enjoy, something not overly bitter. By adding hops late in the boil, we’ve brewed just that, an easy to drink pale ale. A beer for you, for your Old Gent, and for anyone else whose company you keep.",
