  "description": "Before 2014, known as Octoberfest.\r\n\r\nOctoberfest is a rich mahogany colored beer with an inviting toasted malty aroma. The beer has a medium body and a delicate sweetness with a rich nutty malt flavor. Octoberfest is made with our lager yeast and aged cold for a smoothness that eases well into a slightly dry finish and great drinkability. Come help us celebrate the transition from summer to fall with a glass of our Octoberfest and a warm autumn spirit in mind.",
