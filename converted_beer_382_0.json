  "description": "The collection of English ingredients and a change in the brewing process gives a very authentic flavour to the Old Brown Duck. However, putting nitrogen through the beer fives a smoothness you might not expect. Deep malt flavours and a touch of roasty dryness blend with the resinous hop bitterness to really keep the Old Brown Duck on its perch as a fine example of beloved old world style with a new world twist.",
